This is an update of the [Adafruit VS1053 Library](https://github.com/danclarke/Adafruit_VS1053_Library) as modified by Dan Clarke, adding support for user-specified SPI pins.

Other changes from the Adafruit source up to v1.2.0 have now been incorporated into the library files. The examples are still downlevel.

It's currently not fully tested!
